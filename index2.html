       üçΩÔ∏è Meal Ticketing System for Large Organization
Tech Stack: PHP, Laravel, MySQL, HTML/CSS, PDF Generator Library (e.g. DomPDF or TCPDF)

Overview:
Designed and developed a dynamic meal ticketing system to streamline staff food distribution across multiple vendors within a large organization.

Key Features:

üîÅ Vendor Shuffling Logic:
Implemented a randomized vendor allocation mechanism allowing staff to receive meals from different vendors on different days. Upon login, the system automatically shuffles vendors and generates a digital ticket indicating the assigned vendor for the day.

üéüÔ∏è Ticket Generation:
Each ticket includes the vendor name, meal date, staff ID, and QR code for verification. Staff can only claim food from the vendor assigned on the ticket for that day.

üìä Daily Vendor Reporting:
Developed a reporting system in the vendor admin backend that tracks how many meals were served each day. Vendors can view, download, and print a PDF report of all meals served daily.

üìÑ Automated PDF Reports:
Integrated PDF generation for daily reports to help vendors keep
 accurate logs of service counts, including staff details, timestamps, and total meals provided.

Impact:

Reduced logistical issues with food distribution

Ensured fair distribution among vendors

Improved transparency and accountability


üß† Facial Recognition Web Application with Anti-Spoofing
Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Flask/Laravel (optional), JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Overview:
Developed a secure facial recognition web platform with an intuitive user interface for facial registration, login, and logout processes. Focused on identity verification and anti-spoofing for real-world deployment.

Key Features:

üì∏ Facial Registration with Live Capture:
Users register by capturing three real-time facial images. The system verifies liveliness by requiring a blink to ensure the face is not static or a spoof (e.g. a printed photo).

üëÅÔ∏è Blink Detection:
Integrated real-time blink detection using OpenCV to verify that the subject is human and live, both during registration and authentication.

üîê Login & Logout Authentication:
Authentication is triggered with facial recognition and blink verification. System logs the user in or out based on validated facial match.

üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Spoofing Mechanism:
Anti-spoofing logic checks for facial consistency, depth, and micro-movements 
to prevent fake image or video attacks.

üé® Modern UI:
Built with a clean, responsive front-end interface to ensure ease of use 
for both technical and non-technical users.

Impact:

Enhanced biometric authentication reliability

Minimized unauthorized access risks

Provided secure and seamless user experience
